# Stock-Market-Predictor-Analysis-Dashboard
An end-to-end stock market analytics and forecasting project that combines Power BI dashboards with machine learning and deep learning–based predictive models to deliver historical insights, market intelligence, and future price forecasts.

🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data, identifying trends and market regimes, evaluating predictive models, and forecasting future stock prices using LSTM deep learning models.
The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for clear visualization, comparison, and decision support.

A complete dashboard walkthrough video is also included for demonstration.
